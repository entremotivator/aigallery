# EntreMotivator – Gallery of AI Agents  
**An Immersive Three.js Virtual Experience**

The **EntreMotivator Gallery of AI Agents** is an interactive 3D virtual gallery built with **Three.js**, designed to showcase intelligent systems, autonomous agents, and creative AI technologies inside a fully navigable digital environment.

This project reimagines the traditional art gallery as a **living ecosystem of AI**, where visitors can explore and interact with advanced agents such as **LangChain**, **Auto-GPT**, **CrewAI**, **ChatDev**, and more. Each agent is presented as a curated exhibit within a realistic virtual space, blending visual storytelling with functional intelligence.

Visitors don’t just view exhibits — they **navigate intelligence**.

## Features

### 🏛 Virtual Gallery Environment
A fully rendered 3D gallery powered by Three.js, featuring realistic lighting, spatial depth, and architectural layout. The environment mirrors the feel of a modern physical gallery while remaining entirely digital.

### 🤖 AI Agent Exhibits
Each AI agent is displayed as a dedicated 3D installation. Visitors can approach and interact with agents to learn their purpose, capabilities, and real-world use cases — from autonomous task execution to collaborative workflows and software generation.

### 🎮 Interactive Navigation
Users can freely explore the gallery using mouse and keyboard controls. Move forward and backward, turn, look around, and experience the gallery from a first-person perspective.

### 📚 Intelligent Exhibit Information
Interacting with an exhibit reveals contextual information about the AI agent, including its framework, role, and applications. This adds an educational layer while keeping the experience immersive.

### 🎨 Customizable Experience
The gallery supports customization options such as layout configuration, lighting adjustments, and ambient settings — making it suitable for demos, branded showcases, and experimental exhibitions.
