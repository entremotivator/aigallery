EntreMotivator – Gallery of AI Agents
An Immersive Three.js Virtual Experience
The EntreMotivator Gallery of AI Agents is an immersive virtual gallery built with Three.js, designed to showcase intelligent systems, digital agents, and creative AI technologies inside a fully interactive 3D environment.
This project transforms the traditional art gallery concept into a living ecosystem of AI, where visitors can explore, interact with, and learn from advanced agents such as LangChain, Auto-GPT, CrewAI, ChatDev, and more. Each agent is presented as a curated exhibit within a realistic virtual space, blending visual design with functional intelligence.
Users don’t just view exhibits—they navigate intelligence.
Key Features
Virtual Gallery Environment
A fully rendered 3D gallery powered by Three.js, featuring realistic lighting, spatial depth, and architectural layout. The environment is designed to feel like a modern, physical gallery while remaining entirely digital.
AI Agent Exhibits
Each AI agent is displayed as a dedicated 3D installation. Visitors can approach an agent to understand its role, capabilities, and use cases—ranging from autonomous task execution to collaborative workflows and software generation.
Interactive Navigation
Users can move freely through the gallery using mouse and keyboard controls. They can walk forward and backward, turn, look around, and explore the space intuitively, creating a first-person gallery experience.
Intelligent Exhibit Information
Interacting with an exhibit reveals contextual information about the AI agent, including its purpose, underlying framework, and real-world applications. This adds an educational layer to the experience while keeping it engaging.
Customizable Environment
The gallery supports customization options such as layout configuration, lighting adjustments, and ambient settings. This allows the experience to be tailored for demos, exhibitions, or branded showcases.
Project Overview
The EntreMotivator Gallery of AI Agents demonstrates how Three.js can be used beyond visual art—serving as a platform for AI storytelling, education, and interaction. By combining immersive 3D design with modern AI frameworks, the project creates a unique space to explore, understand, and present intelligent systems in a compelling way.
This gallery is ideal for AI showcases, product demos, education, and experimental digital exhibitions, offering a new way to experience artificial intelligence.
Installation
After cloning or downloading the project from GitHub, open your terminal and run:
npm install
This installs all required dependencies. A node_modules folder will appear in your project directory.
Then start the development server:
npm run dev
The gallery will launch locally and be ready to explore.
